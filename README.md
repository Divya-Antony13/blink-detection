### Project Description
A groundbreaking, life-derailing web app that uses real-time face detection to count blinks from multiple people
‚Äî because one face was simply not useless enough. 
Presenting: MultiBlink Madness‚Äì The More You Blink, The Less It Matters.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people are blinking‚Ä¶ unchecked.
Billions of blinks go unnoticed every day. 
What if we told you there‚Äôs no blinking justice in this world?
Who blinks more in class? 
Who‚Äôs the blink king of your squad?
We had to find out. No one asked us to.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combined face detection, blink tracking, and the raw power of useless ambition to create a web app that not only counts blinks but also tells you statistics you‚Äôll never use. Compete with your friends to become the ‚ÄúBlink Champion.‚Äù Stream your stats live. Make blinking weirdly competitive. Because why not doing something useless?

It stares back. And counts how often you blink. And your friend. And that random person who just photobombed.  

Yes, it detects multiple faces.  
Yes, it tracks each person‚Äôs individual blink stats.  
No, it doesn‚Äôt improve your life in any meaningful way.  
But hey ‚Äî now you can finally compete with your friends over who blinks more during awkward silences
